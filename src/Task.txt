	//printf("Shell no:%d",nshell);
	// 1.commands to be implemented
	// cp- use open , create file of 1/10/100 MB  and time to copy
	// a simple shell
	//	- an infinite loop
	//	- display prompt
	//	- Reading  a line of keyboard input as command
	//	- spawn a process  having new process and execute user's command
	//2. Shell read a line from input,
	//     -parse the line, hey commands and input
	//     - first look cmd in current directory,
	//     -if not fund search in the spacal variable path
	//     - should not run /usr/bin untill it is added to path
	//     - filename do not have spaces in between
	//     - may have max paraetres but mus have infinite lines for input
	//	-executable filename is sh, and do not execute /bin/sh
	//3. - few cmds are not separate programs. like exit
	//	- implement cd   - chdir - if it do not work fine then handle exception , do not exit
	//	-pushd as cd - push in stach, popd as off the stack and  cd into it
	// 	-dirs print the content of the stacks
	//4. path hold possible paths to search for executables.
	//	- by default path is empty, may grow arbitrary size.
	// write cmd to control path
	//	path		display
	//	path + some dir	add
	//	path - some dir remove
